    Our Story

GiveWell started with a simple question: Where should I donate?
As a group of eight friends, employed in the finance industry and researching these questions in our spare time, we discovered that finding the best giving opportunities isn't a part-time job. The issues charities address—from fighting disease in Africa to improving education in the U.S.—are extremely complex, and useful information about what different charities do and whether it works is rarely publicly available. When we asked private foundations to share what they'd found and help us with our decisions, they refused. We believe that information about how to help people should never be secret.

We also believe that small donors matter. Small donors help charities develop broad, diverse bases of support, which provide stability for charities to plan and grow. And if we guide even a small portion of individual donors—who are responsible for the vast majority of giving in the United States—to the best giving opportunities we can find, we would signal to the international aid sector that effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and transparency are important to donors. Ultimately, these actions could help change the rules of the game: We picture a market that rewards charities for their ability to help people, not just for their marketing.

In 2007, two members of the group, Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld (bios), left our jobs, raised $300,000 in startup funds from former coworkers who believed in us and our mission, and started GiveWell as a full-time project.

The full history of our progress and business plans, detailing our efforts since then, is available on our progress page. Notably, we incubated the Open Philanthropy Project at GiveWell, which became a separate entity in June 2017.

Giving What We Can is a community of effective givers.

We support each other in our commitments to helping others and learning about effective giving. We aim to create a culture where people are inspired to give more, and give more effectively.

Our Mission
Inspire donations to the world’s most effective organisations

We believe that charitable donations can do an astonishing amount of good. However, the impact can vary wildly depending on where we donate. Because the difference between charities is astounding, it is important that we donate to the most effective charities if we want to have a significant impact.

Our Values
We aspire to be a welcoming community, sharing our passion and energy to improve the lives of others. Some of our core values include:

Caring: A deep commitment to helping others, a dedication to helping each other to give more and better;
Taking action: Following through with our commitments, acting based on evidence, researching new opportunities, putting our money where our mouth is;
Openness: Being open-minded towards new evidence and reasoning, honest about what we don’t know, open about mistakes we’ve made;
Optimism: An ambitious and enthusiastic belief that we can create significant positive change and build a better world.
Our History
Giving What We Can was conceived of by Oxford philosopher Toby Ord. He was inspired by the ideas of ethicists such as Peter Singer to commit to donating a large proportion of his income to effective charities.

In November 2009, Toby and fellow Oxford philosopher Will MacAskill launched Giving What We Can as an international community of people who were committed to giving more, and giving more effectively.

Giving What We Can was one of the first in a growing network of like-minded organisations focused on effective altruism, the project of using evidence and reason to figure out how to best contribute to helping others, and taking action on that basis.

The Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) was incorporated in 2011 as registered charity and an umbrella organization for Giving What We Can and the then newly founded 80,000 Hours. CEA is also the home of EA Funds, and Forethought Foundation. Other organisations associated with the effective altruism movement include Animal Charity Evaluators, GiveWell, The Life You Can Save, Open Philanthropy, and the Future of Humanity Institute.

A Growing Movement
We now have 5,068 members, who have pledged to donate at least 10% of their income over the course of their careers, and 549 members who have made other significant commitments. So far, our members have donated more than $197,318,543 to charity and pledged to donate $1,792,373,255.
